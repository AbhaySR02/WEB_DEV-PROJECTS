# Odin Recipes

A simple HTML project to build a basic recipe website as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). This project demonstrates HTML structure, linking pages, and creating content-rich web pages without any styling or JavaScript.

## Project Structure

The project is structured to include multiple recipe pages linked from a main index page.

### Iteration 1: Initial Structure
1. Created an `index.html` file with basic HTML boilerplate.
2. Added a main heading (`<h1>Odin Recipes</h1>`) to serve as the site’s title.

### Iteration 2: Recipe Page
1. Added a `recipes` directory within the main project folder.
2. Created individual recipe pages within this directory, named after each recipe (e.g., `lasagna.html`).
3. Each recipe page contains a heading with the dish’s name.
4. Linked each recipe back to the `index.html` page.

### Iteration 3: Recipe Page Content
Each recipe page contains:
- An **image** of the finished dish under the main heading.
- A **Description** section with a short paragraph about the dish.
- An **Ingredients** section listing all necessary ingredients as an unordered list.
- A **Steps** section with an ordered list of instructions for making the dish.

### Iteration 4: Additional Recipes
Added two additional recipes with identical structure:
- Linked all recipe pages from the index page, organizing them in an unordered list for easier readability.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/odin-recipes.git
    ```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the main page and navigate to each recipe.

## Project Preview
This project helps build foundational HTML skills and serves as a basis for more advanced projects involving CSS and JavaScript. It’s a straightforward project but shows the essential elements of creating linked web pages with organized content.
